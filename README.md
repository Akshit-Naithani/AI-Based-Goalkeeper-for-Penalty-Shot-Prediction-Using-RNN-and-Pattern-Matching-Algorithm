# AI-Based-Goalkeeper-for-Penalty-Shot-Prediction-Using-RNN-and-Pattern-Matching-Algorithm
This program is based on peanlty shootouts in football (soccor) and tries to imitate the behavior of a goalkeeper. It is a simple program which uses the Recurrent Neural Network as well as a Pattern Matching Algorithm to predict the next shot taken by the user. The AI is trained for 1000 shots initially so that it creates a dataset and makes the goalkeeper more harder to score against. With a little change in code you can even provide your own training data-set and as well as your own patterns of shot. The program keeps track of the goals saved and the goals scored and displays message about the penalty that was just shot. 
Execute the file by double clicking the Peanlty Shootout.py file or running it in an python environment software and wait for 1-2 minutes (AI is trained for 1000 shots initially, so the time depends upon your hardware specifications might take longer on older CPUs).
These are the inputs allowed:
Top Left - This input puts the shot at the top left position of the goal.
Top Right - This input puts the shot at top right position of the goal.
Bottom Left - This input puts the shot at the bottom left position of the goal.
Bottom Right - This input puts the shot at the bottom right position of the goal.
Center - This input puts the shot at the center of the goal.
Stop/End - Closes the program and displays the scatter chart of the shots taken.
